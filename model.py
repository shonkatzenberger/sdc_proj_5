# This is the factor by which the CNN shrinks spatial dimensions (when double and quad are false).
_spatialShrinkFactor = 32

# Builds the CNN model, for either training or prediction. The model has five convolutions that
# use stride 2, thus reducing the spatial dimensions by a factor of 2^5 = 32. These are followed
# by some 1x1 convolutions that essentially play the role of the fully connected layers in
# a typical DNN. This uses all convolutions so it can be applied to images larger than those
# used for training. Thus, the convolutions take care of "windowing" for us, keeping the bulk of
# the number crunching in the GPU, where it belongs.
#
# The 'double' and 'quad' parameters control additional sampling, useful for prediction (not used when training).
# When 'double' is True (but 'quad' is not), the last striding convolution is modified to use stride 1.
# This effectively adds additional outputs half-way (spatially) between the normal outputs.
# When 'quad' is True, the last two striding convolutions are modified to use stride 1 and the last
# striding convolution is modified to use dilation of 2. This effectively adds additional outputs quarter-ways
# (spatially) between the normal outputs.
#
# The weights parameter can contain a dictionary of weights to use. If weights is None or a needed weight
# isn't in the dictionary, a variable is introduced and added to the dictionary. When training, weights
# is initially set to None, while for prediction, weights is a dictionary containing previously trained weights.
#
# This returns a list of layers and the weights dictionary.
